## Review criteria

This assignment is worth a total of 10 points:

3 points will be given if a program is written.

2 points will be given if the program compiles correctly.

5 points will be given if the program correctly prints a JSON object with keys ("name", "address") and they are associated with the name and address that was entered.

Write a program which prompts the user to first enter a name, and then enter an address. Your program should create a map and add the name and address to the map using the keys “name” and “address”, respectively. Your program should use Marshal() to create a JSON object from the map, and then your program should print the JSON object.

Submit your source code for the program, “makejson.go”.
