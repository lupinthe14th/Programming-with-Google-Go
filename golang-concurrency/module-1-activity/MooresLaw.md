# What's Mooreâ€™s law 
- Predicted that transistor density would double every 2 years.

   - Not physical law, just an observation.

# Why Moore's law has now stopped being true 
- Increasing transistor density leads to increased power consumption        
- if you could put more transistors on there, you got to be careful about power and specifically in power and its impact on temperature.
- High power leads to high temperature

   - Air cooling fans can only remove so much heat

- Temperature is probably the biggest wall there, but power is also an important thing because if you want to have portable devices, you have a battery, you don't want to run out your battery instantly.
