# What's Mooreâ€™s law 
- Predicted that transistor density would double every 2 years.

   - Not physical law, just an observation.

# Why Moore's law has now stopped being true 
- High power leads to high temperature.
- Increasing transistor density leads to increased power consumption.
- If you can place more transistors, you need to be aware of the effects on power, especially power and temperature.
- Denard scaling cannot be continued for these reasons.

   - The voltage swing between low and high has to be higher than the threshold voltage of the transistor.
   - Noise problems occur.
   - It doesn't consider leakage power.
