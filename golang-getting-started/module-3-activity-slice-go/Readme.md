## Review criteria

This assignment is worth a total of 10 points:

3 points will be given if a program is written.

2 points will be given if the program compiles correctly.

A maximum of 3 points will be given for the first test execution, if the program correctly prints the sorted slice after entering three distinct integers. **Points are awarded incrementally each time that an integer is added and it correctly prints the sorted slice.

A maximum of 2 points will be given for the second test execution, if the program correctly prints the sorted slice after entering four distinct integers. **Points are awarded if it correctly prints the sorted slice after adding the fourth integer.

## Desigh

Write a program which prompts the user to enter integers and stores the integers in a sorted slice. The program should be written as a loop. Before entering the loop, the program should create an empty integer slice of size (length) 3. During each pass through the loop, the program prompts the user to enter an integer to be added to the slice. The program adds the integer to the slice, sorts the slice, and prints the contents of the slice in sorted order. The slice must grow in size to accommodate any number of integers which the user decides to enter. The program should only quit (exiting the loop) when the user enters the character ‘X’ instead of an integer.

Submit your source code for the program, “slice.go”.
